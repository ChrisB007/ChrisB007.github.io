# Project Title: Guess 'N' Time


##Game Overview</br>
The purpose of this multi-player game is to appoint one player who 'describes using words'
either 'images or keywords' that is shown on the screen via 'GameBox', and the other players
to guess correctly without sufficient information. The first player **MUST NOT** disclose / mention
the object shown in the image by its name or keyword, instead he/she has to associate it by reference (with other objects)or by action.

##Game Rules</br>
1. Do not callout or disclose the objects in the image by its name or keyword<br>
2. You can ONLY reference the object in the image to other objects or by acting it out.<br>
3. A complete game consists of six turns for each player.<br>
4. Each player has 20 seconds to describe/ guess the image/word in each turn.<br>
5. The winner gets bar stacks added to his/her container.<br>
6. Whoever has the most bars (That reaches the top of the container first) wins the game - Game ends.<br>
